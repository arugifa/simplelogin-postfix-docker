# Docker Image for SimpleLogin Postfix

No official Postfix image, tailor-made for [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/),
currently exists.

Let's fix that, by providing to the community something very lightweight,
secure\* (with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) support) and simple to use 💖

\* if a TLS certificate cannot be automatically generated when starting the container, Postfix will run without TLS activated, until the next attempt (happens every hour)

Can be configured with the following environment variables:

Setting     | Description
----------- | -------------------------------------------
**ALIASES_DEFAULT_DOMAIN** | Default domain to use for your aliases.
**DB_HOST** | Where is hosted your SimpleLogin PostgreSQL database.
**DB_USER** | User to connect to the database.
**DB_PASSWORD** | User's password to connect to the database.
**DB_NAME** | Name of the database.
**EMAIL_HANDLER_HOST** | Where is hosted your SimpleLogin email handler instance.
**LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL** | Email address used by Let's Encrypt, to send you expiry notices\*.
**POSTFIX_FQDN** | Fully Qualified Domain Name of your Postfix instance (i.e., the MX server address you configured in your DNS zone for your **ALIASES_DEFAULT_DOMAIN**).
**RELAY_HOST** | Optional next-hop destination for non-local mail

\* automatic renewal is managed with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and shouldn't fail, unless you have reached Let's Encrypt [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/)

Used by and made for [Kloügle](https://github.com/arugifa/klougle), the Google
alternative automated with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).


## Troubleshooting

If you don't receive emails from SimpleLogin, have a look to Postfix logs:
```sh
docker logs -f <POSTFIX_CONTAINER>
```

If Postfix doesn't seem to use TLS, have a look to Certbot logs:
```sh
docker exec -ti <POSTFIX_CONTAINER> cat /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
```
